.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBProZilla\fR is a download program that makes multiple connections and downloads a file in multiple parts from different servers simultaneously, thus enhancing the download speed and downloading the file faster than a download with a single connection.

ProZilla  is  able to do ftp searches for other possible sites that contain the same file, ping them for connection speeds and automatically download from the fastest sites.

FTP passwords can be specified with the URL, or can be obtained automatically from  \fB~/.netrc\fR if it exists.
