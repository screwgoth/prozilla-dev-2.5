-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * FIXED: Look into "Average Speed" way off on resumes.
 * Look into making the downloaded file's date/time match the remote file
 * Check the Remotely exploitable format string in 1.3
 * Check the handling of bad Commandline options in 1.3
 * Take a look at the k variable in the mass_ping request, upgrade url.c 
to latest versions, move all the logfile locks to a single section, 
there is no need for seperate mutex loxks etc. 

 * Write or generate API documentation.

 * Honor the environment variables http_proxy and ftp_proxy. 
   NOTE: Should this be part of libprozilla or the interface?
   Grendel: I think this should be part of the interface, the interface 
can allways tell libprozilla the proxy to use.	

 * Port to other platforms than GNU/Linux, e.g. SunOS/Solaris, FreeBSD etc...

 * Add cookies support.
 
 * Make the threads download to a single file, will need a state monitor
   which saves the state of each thread to resume properly. 
Note:libprozilla already does this.	

 * Bandwidth throttling? Note:ALready done.

 * Use libtool.

 * I need to stat the file's size, so we have to check and include
    sys/stat.h in common.h

 * DONE: refreer support ftp

 * The FTP through HTTP proxying needs a bit of chechin on how it would
  handle login rejection attempts when the ftp server disallows it

  * DONE: write a function for getting the version of libprozilla
