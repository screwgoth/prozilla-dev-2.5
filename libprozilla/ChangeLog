	* src/Makefile.am (CPPFLAGS): @CPPFLAGS@ added so that the
	CPPFLAGS environment variable is used. Patch from Alejandro Pulver

2005-11-12    <kalum@genesys.ro>

	* src/connection.c (proz_connection_get_total_remote_bytes_got):
	There appears to be a bug when resuming when a too high total

	throttling was giving weird results when running in resume
	mode,this was fixed.
	(connection_calc_ratebps): Made it delay a bit before calculating
	the initial rate so as to avoid high values as the start, the delay makes
	it calculate the rate more accurately.

2005-09-04    <kalum@genesys.ro>

	* src/ftpsearch.c (get_string_ahref): Fixed the unchecked
	strncpy(), as discovered by Tavis Ormandy <taviso@gentoo.org>

	introduced into the current code whereby a file not found was not
	generated on some servers when the file was not found.

2005-08-27    <kalum@genesys.ro>

	* src/ftp.c (proz_ftp_get_url_info): If the remote server returns
	  FTPNSFOD which could be due to the fact that the server doesnt
     	  permit the directory contents to be listed we will print a
	  warning and return  FTPOK as it is not a fatal error.

2005-08-26    <kalum@genesys.ro>

	the code which sets the start position of the thread on resuming,
	this bug was responsible for the negative time display and
	corruption when a resumed download was restarted due to a remote failure.

2005-07-31    <kalum@genesys.ro>

	* src/ftpparse1.c: This new file was added which contains routines
	for improved parsing of the LIST command from ftp servers, for the
	moment it supports only getting the file size from a unix server.

	* src/ftp.c (proz_ftp_get_url_info): Now we use the SIZE command
	to get the file size, and then we parse the LIST command and get
	the file size and other info.

2005-07-27    <kalum@genesys.ro>

	* src/connect.c (connect_to_server): SO_KEEPALIVE enabled as
	suggested by Pawel Pokrywka <publicpp@gmail.com>, patch merged.

	* src/misc.c (show_message): added a wrapper for routine to callback a message displaying routine.

          This will open connection->localfile and read from
	  connection->data_sock (which should be already setup) till the
	  requested number of bytes are read.
	  Now since we explicitly know how much bytes to get we can do so,
          and is the server  closes the connection prematurely we know that 
	  it has hapenned (because it hasn't supplied the required number
          of bytes) and return a READERR.

         is reached or the server closes the connection, in which case there is no way to know 
         whether we got the complete file.
