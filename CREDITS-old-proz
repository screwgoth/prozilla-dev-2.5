This is a list of people who contributed to the old branch of prozilla, ie the console one, it is only fair to them that I list them here as the encouragement given to me for the old prozilla project was vital int he developement of libprozilla.

Richard Dawe <richdawe@bigfoot.com>
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Makefile fixes, several bugfixes, beta testing, correction of spelling,
and the gproz script for starting Prozilla in gtk mode, and for several
excellent suggestions for improvement, the prompting for overwriting files
were all his suggestions, he also submitted the patch which made prozilla
access the appropriate sysconfdir/prozilla.conf file it was compiled with.

Biscuit <biscut@biscut.screaming.net>
-------------------------------------
Beta testing, and suggestions for improvement.

Wget and it's author
--------------------
For a well designed utility. I used it's URL
parsing function and some of it's HTTP code for the download accelerator.

Lourens Veen <jsr@dds.nl>
-------------------------
Discovered a important bug due to incompatibilities in the ncurses libraries
function definitions between versions 4.x and 5.x. Also found a compilation 
problem due to a missing header file. 

D. J. Bernstein <djb@pobox.com>
-------------------------------
I adopted his well designed ftp parsing library (ftpparse.c and ftpparse.h)
for the FTP LIST commands output. His code made the parsing of LIST commands
output which has no defined format, much easier.

Flower <floweros@golia.ro>
--------------------------
Bug reports, and a lot suggestions for improvement. ProZilla 1.01 contains
a lot of his suggestions, and has made Prozilla more versatile and stable.
He also added the support for a configuration file for prozilla and
cleaned up the part regarding the installation of the manpages.

Silviu Marin-Caea <silviu@delrom.ro>
------------------------------------
For his persistence in tracking down bugs, and for his practical
suggestions, the most important one was to encourage me to add the retry
feature for each connection and correcting a bug with the percent counter.
Many of the new changes in ProZilla 1.04b are due to feedback from him.
The mailing list <prozilla@delrom.ro> was provided by him which has helped
in the development of prozilla a lot and thanks too for the bug report
related to the premature termination of the downloads.

Ralph Slooten <ralph.slooten@quicknet.nl>
-----------------------------------------
He corrected some of my faulty English in the connection display, it now
more appropriately displays "Completed" instead of "All done" and the
errors README, and also for the suggestions for future improvement and
testing of ProZilla, together with contributing RPM's of prozilla.

Tse Chi Ming <minix@hongkong.com>
-----------------------------------------
He informed me about a bug which occurred with version 1.06pre0 when files
less than 7 bytes in size were downloaded using the http protocol.

"Gustavo Noronha Silva (KoV)" <dockov@zaz.com.br>
-------------------------------------------------
The prozilla man page was written by him, and he is acting as the debian
maintainer for prozilla. He also brought to notice an important bug in the
ftp code.

Calum Selkirk <cselkirk@sophix.uklinux.net>
-------------------------------------------
For the modified RPM script.

Seth Cohn <scohn@oregonmed.net>
-------------------------------
He brought to my notice the bug that caused the screen corruption and also
suggested a way to fix it.

Davy Durham <david.durham@wcom.com>
-----------------------------------
He did testing, and suggestions.

Uwe Hermann <uh1763@hermann-uwe.de>
-----------------------------------
For the patch which corrected my incorrect spelling, and for the ideas
about correcting the layout of the distribution, and the changes to the
man page.

Drew <drew@no6.com>
-------------------
For the idea to add a progress displayer for the file rebuilding process
once the download is completed.

Steven Hatfield <ashari@knightswood.net>
---------------------------------------
He reported the bug about the ~./netrc file being not handled. 

Guillermo Pereyra Irujo <gpirujo@pop3free.com>
----------------------------------------------
For informing that in the curses display the status and received titles
were reversed.  

Andy Jeffries <andy@scramdisk.eu.org>
-------------------------------------
Suggesting that support for bandwith limiting should be implemented.

Michael Duelli <m.duelli@web.de>
--------------------------------
Patches correcting sytaxes and simplifying the code in the help and
license functions, and adding support so prozilla can download multiple
URL's (not yet added). He also corrected the over scrolling which occured
in the curses window. The new burst download speed indicator is also
thanks to him.

Kalum Somaratna <kalum@delrom.ro> 
---------------------------------
Hmm..thats me..well what can you say about yourself ;). Well I designed
Prozilla and coded most of it from scratch, with the kind help and
contributions from all the people above. I also contributed to unfound
bugs (hopefully none) lurking out there...
