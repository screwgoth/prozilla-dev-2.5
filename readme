		ProZilla the Download Accelerator for Linux
                              GUI 2.04 Release
                ============================================

Welcome, gentle reader.

ProZilla is a download accelerator for Linux which gives you a 200% to
300% improvement (or possibly more depending on your connection) in your
file downloading speeds.
 
Features:
Supports FTP
Supports HTTP including redirection. 
Proxy servers supported.
Resume Supported.
Improved error checking and correction.
Complete acceleration: The file will be downloaded as fast as possible as
your bandwidth allows. 
FTP passwords can be specified with the URL, or can be obtained
automatically from the .netrc if it exists.
The number of connections that prozilla uses can be changed.

***NEW**
Now the downloads are ALL to a SINGLE file. There is no downloading to 
individual files as was done previously.
Multiple server based downlaoding is supported  based on ftpsearch and 
ping results obtaines for a URL prozilla will attempt to make multiple 
connections to different servers and try to speed up the download even 
more. 


1. Configuring
--------------
Please type,
./configure
from the ProZilla directory to configure the package.

Typing ./configure --help, will show you the various options that you can
use to change the configuration process.

2. Building
----------- 
Once the configuration process is finished, please type 
make 
to start the compilation of the package.

3. Installing
-------------
If the make process was successful, then you can install it by typing
make install
which will install the binaries in the /usr/local/bin directory by default.
If you wish another directory, you can change this with the --prefix option
supplied to configure.

If you wish that the binaries be stripped too (reduces the size), please
type
make install-strip


4. Running
----------
Running:
The syntax will be,
proz <URL>
where URL is the file you wish to download.

For example,
proz  ftp://gnu.org/pub/README
will connect to to the server gnu.org and start the download of the file
README from the pub directory.

If you want ProZilla to use a different username or password for ftp sessions,
than the default anonymous login, you can specify it in the command line, or
if you have a .netrc file, it will automatically select the appropriate
username password combination for the particular host, otherwise it will use
the default anonymous login.


A small note
------------
ProZilla was written by Kalum Somaratana (aka Grendel) <kalum@genesys.ro>
For the complete list of the people who were kind enough to contribute to
ProZilla please read the CREDITS file and the AUTHORS file.

It was written to fulfill the need of a good quality download accelerator
for Linux, which would allow users (especially the people with slow dialup
connections) to download files as fast as possible as their connection
would allow. 

For Windoze users there already existed a good download accelerator but
for Linux users unfortunately there wasn't much of a choice, and we hope
that ProZilla will improve that situation considerably.

Although we have taken great pains to test this application extensively,
there probably may be a few bugs :(, since this is the first major
release. However if you come across them we kindly request you to inform
us <prozilla@genesys.ro> and we will make sure that they will be
removed from the next release.

We sincerely hope that you will like the download accelerator..
Enjoy!
